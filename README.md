## 1. System Requirements
In order to enable the full functionality of this app, a browser that supports geolocation access
via http connection is required. Some browsers (such as Safari) block geolocation access via
http connection. As a result, the app cannot locate and zoom into user positions if it is opened
in those browsers. Therefore, it is recommended to use Chrome(Version 73.0.3683.75 or above)
or Firefox(Version 65.0.2 or above) for this app.

This app requires to make connections to a Ubuntu Server (Virtual Machine). You could
use BitVise, Pycharm (Version 2018.3.5 Professional Edition) or other SSH software to connect
to the Ubuntu Server.

If you are going to use this app outside the UCL campus (not connected to Eduroam), make
sure you are connected to UCL VPN by following the instructions
at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/remote-working-services/ucl-virtualprivate-network-vpn.
